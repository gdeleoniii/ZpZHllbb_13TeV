*** For uncertainty study on signal efficiency ***

1. The format of folders in this directory is uncertaintySource.onWhichSamples

2. All the uncertainty studies on signal efficiency are located in *.signal folders.

3. Inside each *.signal forders, you can see a .C file and a .h file. 

4. The .h file is the analysis code, which read the skimmed samples and specific some parameters like lepton channel or number of b-tag . The function in these .h files always return the signal efficiency according to this mass point.

5. The .h files read some neccessary files. Make sure that you have everything before running the codes.
   
   5.1 The BTagCalibrationStandalone.h in https://github.com/henrytongCMS/ZpZHllbb_13TeV/tree/master/bTagCalhead
   5.2 The CSVV1.csv in                   https://github.com/henrytongCMS/ZpZHllbb_13TeV/blob/master/CSVV1.csv
   5.3 The b-tag efficiency root files in https://github.com/henrytongCMS/ZpZHllbb_13TeV/tree/master/bTagEffroot
   5.4 The lepton and trigger scale factor root files in https://github.com/henrytongCMS/ZpZHllbb_13TeV/tree/master/leptonSFroot
   5.5 Other header files can be found in https://github.com/henrytongCMS/ZpZHllbb_13TeV

6. The .C file using the numbers from .h file to do uncertainty study and output the numbers to a text file.

7. In summary, the usage is simple, just run this command and it will do anything for you: root -q -b -l codeName.C\(\)

*** For uncertainty study on alpha ratio ***

1. All the uncertainty studies on alpha ratio are located in *.zjets folders. Please create a folder named "Zjets" first.

2. Inside each *.zjets folders, you can see two .C files and two .sh files. 

3. The *Tree.C file analyze the skimmed samples and create a mini tree for RooFit (will be saved in "Zjets" folder). This code can be run easily with ./runTree.sh

4. The rooFitAlpha.C read the mini tree created by *Tree.C, doing unbinned likelihood fit and output results in pdf files. This code can be run easily with ./runAlpha.sh

---> Important: User should modify lines after for loop in runAlpha.sh first <---

5. In summary, run ./runTree.sh, then ./runAlpha.sh
