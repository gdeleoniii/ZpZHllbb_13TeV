Before you running the code, you should prepare some files and do some environment setting:

1. Run the two command below:
   1.1 source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/gcc/4.9/x86_64-slc6-gcc49-opt/setup.sh
   1.2 source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/releases/ROOT/6.04.10/x86_64-slc6-gcc49-opt/root/bin/thisroot.sh

2. Prepare the files in https://github.com/henrytongCMS/ZpZHllbb_13TeV/tree/master/bTagCalhead , run the command in root environment:
   2.1 .L BTagCalibrationStandalone.cpp++

3. Before using RooFit, you also need to prepare the files in https://github.com/henrytongCMS/ZpZHllbb_13TeV/tree/master/PDFs , run the commands in root environment:
   3.1 .L PdfDiagonalizer.cc++
   3.2 .L HWWLVJRooPdfs.cxx++

4. Prepare the header files:
   4.1 https://github.com/henrytongCMS/ZpZHllbb_13TeV/blob/master/untuplizer.h
   4.2 https://github.com/henrytongCMS/ZpZHllbb_13TeV/blob/master/isPassZee.h
   4.3 https://github.com/henrytongCMS/ZpZHllbb_13TeV/blob/master/isPassZmumu.h
   4.4 https://github.com/henrytongCMS/ZpZHllbb_13TeV/blob/master/isPassJet.h
   4.5 https://github.com/henrytongCMS/ZpZHllbb_13TeV/blob/master/leptonWeight.h
   4.6 https://github.com/henrytongCMS/ZpZHllbb_13TeV/blob/master/bTagCalhead/BTagCalibrationStandalone.h

5. Prepare the needed input root files:
   5.1 b-tagging efficiency for b-tagging scale factor: https://github.com/henrytongCMS/ZpZHllbb_13TeV/tree/master/bTagEffroot
   5.2 lepton weight and trigger: https://github.com/henrytongCMS/ZpZHllbb_13TeV/tree/master/leptonSFroot

6. Now you are ready to run the codes.

*** For uncertainty study on signal efficiency ***

1. All the uncertainty studies on signal efficiency are located in uncertaintySource.signal folders, which contain a .C file and a .h file.

2. The .h file is the analysis code, which read the skimmed samples and specific some parameters like lepton channel or number of b-tag . The function in these .h files always return the signal efficiency according to this mass point.

3. The .C file using the numbers from .h file to do uncertainty study and output the numbers to a text file.

4. Run this command and it will do anything for you: root -q -b -l codeName.C\(\)

*** For uncertainty study on alpha ratio ***

1. All the uncertainty studies on alpha ratio are located in uncertaintySource.zjets folders, which contain two .C files and two .sh files.

2. Please create a folder named "Zjets" first.

3. The *Tree.C file analyze the skimmed samples and create a mini tree for RooFit (will be saved in "Zjets" folder). This code can be run easily with ./runTree.sh

4. The rooFitAlpha.C read the mini tree created by *Tree.C, doing unbinned likelihood fit and output results in pdf files. This code can be run easily with ./runAlpha.sh

---> Important: User should modify lines after for loop in runAlpha.sh first <---

5. In summary, run ./runTree.sh, then ./runAlpha.sh
