*** For uncertainty study on signal efficiency ***

1. The format of folders in this directory is uncertaintySource.onWhichSamples

2. All the uncertainty studies on signal efficiency are located in *.signal folders.

3. Inside each *.signal forders, you can see a .C file and a .h file. The .h file is the analysis code, which read the skimmed samples and specific some parameters like lepton channel or number of b-tag . The function in these .h files always return the signal efficiency according to this mass point.

4. The .C file using the numbers from .h file to do uncertainty study and output the numbers to a text file.

5. In summary, the usage is simple, just run this command and it will do anything for you: root -q -b -l codeName.C\(\)
